	 * this is a complex but essential survival routine
	 * the actor is expected to have a method of storing a "psychological pressure" state
	 * many factors can contribute to the actor's pressure, such as:
	 *  - shots landing near the actor (small)
	 *  - the actor is flanked (medium)
	 *  - the actor is caught in the open (huge)
	 *  depending on how pressured the actor is, it would react in different ways to "relieve" the pressure
	 *  so that it may begin pursuing other routines again
	 *  methods of relief may include:
	 *  - crouching/lying down to reduce body area
	 *  - ducking if behind an obstacle
	 *  - fleeing to a more secure obstacle
	 *  - outright fleeing the area
